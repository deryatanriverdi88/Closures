function calcPercent(/*your parameter here */) {
  // Add your code here..
}

const toDoList = 50
const doneWork = 25

// Instructions:
// We have been asked to calculate the percentage of tasks that have been completed. Complete the calcPrecent() function with the following logic:
// calcPrecent() should implement closure for functional programming. The calcPrecent function will take in the total number of tasks(toDoList) and then use an anonymous function which will take in the number of tasks done.
//Then the anonymous function will find the percentage of tasks done (doneWork).
// Finally console log the results.
